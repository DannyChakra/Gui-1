        <h2>What else?</h2>
            <p>In my free time I enjoy working on my motorcycle and playing video games

            </p>
            <p> About 5 months ago I bought a domain and I got a service to host my personal
              website. I was using WordPress but never fully committed on finishing the website.
              During my internship I met an intern who volunteered to design my website so she can
              practice WordPress, and now its basically a non-functional website. I'm hoping that
              I'll learn enough in this class to cutomize my website without using WordPress.
